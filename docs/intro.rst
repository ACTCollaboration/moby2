Introduction
============

``moby2`` is a Python package (with compiled C extensions) to support
the analysis of time-ordered data and single-observation maps for the
Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) Polarimeter (ACTPol).  It is derived
from an earlier package, moby, which filled the same purpose during
the MBAC era of ACT (2007-2010).

The public ACT website is https://act.princeton.edu/.  The home of the
ACT Collaboration on github is https://github.com/ACTCollaboration/.

The code here has been developed over the course of many years, and
some features or modules have been actively maintained while others
have not.  The documentation is in many cases misleading, inaccurate,
or irrelevant.

This code and documentation was made public in March 2020, as part of
supporting the development of the Simons Observatory (SO) pipeline.
ACTPol continues to observe, and ``moby2`` will continue to play a
role in low-level data analysis.  Future improvements to this
documentation will likely only be made insofar as they are useful to
SO development or on-going ACTPol operations.

Most of ``moby2`` is compatible with both Python 2 and Python 3, and
must remain so until all dependent sites have fully upgraded.
